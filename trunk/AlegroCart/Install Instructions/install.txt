=============================================================================================
*** NEW INSTALL  ********
=============================================================================================

**WARNING** THIS IS FOR FRESH INSTALLS ONLY! YOUR DATABASE WILL BE REMOVED!

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Upload all the entire CONTENTS of the "upload" directory to your web directory.
   e.g. public_html or public_html/shop/ (see attached Install.jpg)

2. Make sure the following folders and files are writable. For Linux/Unix use the following:
   chmod a+w image/
   chmod a+w image/cache/
   chmod a+w image/flash/
   chmod a+w cache/
   chmod a+w download/
   chmod a+w config.php

3. Make sure you have access to a MySQL server (remember the login name and the password)
   DO NOT USE YOUR ROOT USERNAME AND ROOT PASSWORD

4. You must create a MySql database called "something" CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci.Remember the name.

5. Visit your shop in your web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.
   e.g. http://www.example.com/ or http://www.example.com/shop/
   Note: It is advisable not to use admin as your superuser. Use a unique user name to avoid brute force hack attempts.

6. After completing the install process make sure config.php is not writable anymore (just for the owner). 
   For Linux/Unix use the following: chmod go-w ../config.php --> chmod 644 ../config.php 

7. Delete the install directory.

===================================================================================================
****   UPGRADE **********
===================================================================================================

1. Take a backup of ALL your files and database.
   For version 1.2.3 or earlier: Make copies of any changes to your modified Template files. These will be deleted in step 3.
   Login in to admin/settings. Change your template and or styles to default.
   
2. Rename config.php to myconfig.php
   (This is your backup of this file. You can also copy to your local computer for backup.)

3. For upgrade to Version 1.2.4: Delete Admin, Catalog, cache, and library folders. These will be completely replaced.
   Upload all the entire contents of the "upload" directory to your web directory except config.php and the hidden .htaccess file.
   The most common problem is the common.php was not uploaded.

4. Restore a copy of config.php if you uploaded empty config.php from distribution.

5. Make sure config.php is writable. 
   For Linux/Unix use the following: chmod a+w config.php --> chmod 666 ../config.php 

6. Run install/upgrade.php in your web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.
   Alternatively, if you login to admin, upgrade will run automatically.The index.php checks the database version against the VERSION in common.php. 
   If they donâ€™t match, you are redirected to the upgrade.php located in the install directory and the upgrade begins. 
   When the upgrade is finished, you will receive a message on screen that you have successfully upgraded and to delete the install directory. 
   If you do not get this message, the upgrade did not complete.

7. After finishing the ungrade process make sure config.php is not writable. 
   For Linux/Unix use the following: chmod go-w ../config.php --> chmod 644 ../config.php 

8. Delete the install directory.

You can now include your modified template and Styles to your upgraded site.
You will have to create your own personal directories.

The new structure is:

catalog/template/yourdirectory/content
							  /module
							  /shared
							  layout.tpl
							  layout_maintenance.tpl
catalog/styles/yourdirectory/css                     (New for version 1.2.3)  
							/colors2/  (Color CSS for color specific layout 2 column)
							/colors3/  (Color CSS for color specific layout 3 column)
							/css2/     (CSS files for 2 column page layout)
							/css3/     (CSS files for 3 column page layout)
							/image/                   
							/image/colore2/  color folders (color images for 2 column layout)
							/image/colore3/  color folders (color images for 3 column layout)

You will have to merge your modifications into the new .tpl files because of structure changes.

=====================
FURTHER CONFIGURATION
=====================

URL Alias
---------

1. To use URL Alias you need to be running apache with mod_rewrite enabled.
   It is turned off in the download. I would suggest browsing some pages first to ensure .htaccess is set up correctly 
   before enabling URL Alias.   

2. Ensure you have permissions to use .htaccess, and that it is setup correctly.
   If you are installing in a sub-directory such as www/shop/ , you need to reflect this path in the .htaccess,
   so change RewriteBase / to RewriteBase /shop/    
   This will set your cart root as http://www.example.com/shop/

3. If you have problems loading pages where the file has an underscore such as user_group, this is not a cart problem,
   but a server security setting. Contact your host to have this reconfigured.
